                <p>Cardiovascular disease is a term used to encompass diseases involving the heart and blood vessels. Many of these diseases can be dangerous and even fatal.<br>
Common types of diseases include:<br>

              	<p><a id="coronaryheartdisease"><span style="font-weight:700">Coronary Heart disease:</span></a><br>
This is the most common form of heart disease in Australia and it comes in two different forms.
Heart attack and angina.
A heart attack occurs when the heart blood vessel is suddenly blocked, which can cause damage to the heart muscle and its functions, making it <span style="font-weight:900">life-threatening.</span>
Angina is a condition when there is a temporary loss of blood supply to the heart and causes periodic chest pain. Despite it not being life-threatening it increases the likelihood of a heart attack.<br>
Symptoms:<br>
Pain, fullness, squeezing of the chest
jaw pain, toothache, headache
shortness of breath<br>
Causes:<br>
Age is the largest risk factor and angina will often increase the risk of heart attack, however lifestyle and diet has a significant impact as this can increase blood cholesterol levels and lead to other diseases such as diabetes that can also lead to heart attacks. Other causes include smoking, obesity, work stress, being HIV positive and heart surgery.<br>
Treatment:<br>
During a heart attack CPR is used to resuscitate the patient in order to bring them back to consciousness. Defibrillator machines are used to try and jump start the heart. A 300mg of Aspirin is administered to help stop blood clots from growing and thin the blood.<br>
Prevention:<br>
The best ways to avoid coronary heart disease is to stay physically active and to maintain a healthy weight by also implementing a healthy diet such as a Mediterranean diet to reduce the risks of a heart attack. Other lifestyle choices such as not smoking and minimizing alcohol intake has a large impact on prevention Heart disease.</p>

				<p><a id="heartfailure"><span style="font-weight:700">Heart failure and cardiomyopathy:</span></a><br>
Heart failure is when the heart becomes weakened so that it cannot maintain enough blood flow through the body. <span style="font-weight:900">It is life-threatening and cannot be cured.</span> Cardiomyopathy is when the heart muscle becomes enlarged, thickened or stiff leading to Heart Failure.<br>
Symptoms:<br>
Chronic tiredness, reduced capacity for physical activities and shortness of breath.
Causes:<br>
Heart attacks are a major cause as they weaken the heart. High blood pressure puts on extra pressure on the heart, causing the muscle to become thicker to compensate. Other causes can be faulty heart valves and other damage to the heart muscle. These can either be self inflicted or genetically determined.<br>
Treatment:<br>
Simple treatment methods would be to live a healthy lifestyle through proper diet and exercise however when the condition has worsened to stage where that is no longer possible there are medications such as diuretics that help lower fluid build-up and ACE inhibitors to reduce blood pressure. If conditions worsen further then surgical procedures are available such as installing a pacemaker.<br>
Prevention:<br>
As there is no cure to heart failure, the best option is to prevent contracting the disease in the first place. Simple ways of doing so are by changing your lifestyle to a healthier one where you incorporate regular exercise and a healthy diet. Other preventative measures that can be taken are to get regular heart scans in order to catch any symptoms before conditions become too serious.</p>

				<p><a id="peripheralvasculardisease"><span style="font-weight:700">Peripheral vascular disease:</span></a><br>
This disease is caused by a narrowed or obstructed blood vessel. The result of this is reduces blood circulation around the body however the brain and heart are not affected. This results in <span style="font-weight:900">atherosclerosis of the peripheral arteries</span> which narrows arteries travelling to legs and feet and can lead to amputation. Another form of the disease is <span style="font-weight:900">abdominal aortic aneurysm</span> which is an abnormal widening of the main artery leading from the heart (aorta). This can be life-threatening and can require surgery.<br>
Symptoms:<br>
Cramp like pains, muscle fatigue or heaviness, heavier pain during exercise and subsiding pain during rest, numbness, coldness of the limb affected, blue of purple tinge to the skin, wounds that don't heal, gangrene<br>
Causes:<br>
Typical physical causes of Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) are smoking, cold temperatures, operating vibrating machinery or tools and emotional stress. There are also organic causes which include diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Other causes also emerge from injuries to the affected limbs, abnormal structures, infection and coronary artery disease.<br>
Treatment:<br>
As is the case with other cardiovascular diseases, simple lifestyle modifications in diet exercise and habits such as drinking and smoking can drastically reduce the risks of PVD. However in more serious cases, there are medications that can help increase blood flow to the legs and that can lower the risk of blood clots and cholesterol levels. Other than medication if there is still no relief from the diseases, surgery is also available, such as angioplasty, where a long tube with a balloon at its tip is inserted into the artery and inflated to open up blockages. Vascular surgery is an option, where a vein from a different part of the body is used to bypass the blockage.<br>
Prevention:<br>
Simple changes to your lifestyle can prevent a whole range of cardiovascular diseases including PVD. These include avoiding smoking, controlling blood sugar, including a healthy diet and exercise program and maintaining a healthy weight. Regular testing is also recommended to catch any diseases early and before they become serious.</p>

				<p><a id="stroke"><span style="font-weight:700">Stroke:</span></a><br>
A stroke occurs, when an artery that supplies blood to the brain suddenly becomes blocked or begins bleeding. This can result in brain damage and is often fatal.
The two main types of strokes are from a blood clot of other particle blocking a blood vessel and the damaging of a blood vessel which results in bleeding of the vessel.
There is also a condition called transient ischaemic attack, which occurs when blood vessel is temporarily blocked and will induce stroke like conditions for a couple of minutes with the affected person experiencing stroke like conditions for up to 24 hours.<br>
Symptoms:<br>
<span style="font-weight:900">If you see someone experiencing a stroke immediately contact emergency services</span> and look for the following signs. Weakness or numbness or paralysis of the face, arm or leg on either both or one side of the body, difficulty in speaking or understanding, loss of balance, loss of vision, severe headaches and difficulty swallowing. Strokes are incredibly dangerous and 1 in 6 will experience having a stoke.<br>
Causes:<br>
Causes of a stroke are from blocked arteries where blood is unable to reach the brain or through the rupturing of an artery in the brain, which will lead to bleeding which can block oxygen and nutrient flow to the brain, causing a stroke.<br>
Treatment:<br>
Early treatment after a stroke is vital, as the earlier a stroke is treated, the more of the brain can be saved. The affected person has to receive medical attention, no matter how small the stroke was in order to increase the chances of a full recovery. At hospital the patient is given a drug that will relieve blood clots if a blocked artery is the cause for the stroke. The patient is then transported to a stroke care unit, where specialised staff either administer the required drugs to relieve blood clots or even surgery to relieve pressure on the brain due to a ruptured vessel.<br>
Prevention:<br>
High blood pressure is a common risk associated with strokes. This can be lowered by incorporating a healthy diet and exercise regime into your lifestyle. This also includes quitting smoking and avoiding other unhealthy habits that can affect your heart and blood vessels, such as excessive alcohol consumption. Furthermore if you suffer from diabetes then controlling your blood sugar is vital to avoid getting a stroke.</p>

				<p><a =id"stroke"><span style="font-weight:700">Congenital heart disease:</span></a><br>
Congenital heart disease is a problem with the structure of the heart which is present at birth. This is one of the leading causes of death in the first year of life.
Symptoms:<br>
Symptoms can appear either at birth or sometime after, which include breathlessness and/or a failure to maintain normal growth. Symptoms however may also only become present at adulthood. Other symptoms also include excessive sweating, extreme tiredness, poor feeding, rapid heartbeat and breathing, chest pain or a blue tinge to the skin.<br>
Causes:<br>
As congenital heart disease is a birth defect, many causes are derived from the habits of the parents in particular the mother. Some of them are genetic or chromosomal which leads to other conditions such as down syndrome. Other causes come from lifestyle choices of the parents, such as taking medication or drinking alcohol or other substance abuse during pregnancy. Also contracting viral infections such as rubella in the first trimester of pregnancy can lead to congenital heart disease.<br>
Treatment:<br>
Depending on the severity of the disease, treatment will vary. In some mild cases treatment is not required, where as others may need to go on medication to treat the condition. In severe cases, surgery may be required to repair the defect. Most adults will be required to be monitored throughout their life time to prevent any serious symptoms form occurring.<br>
Prevention:<br>
Pregnant women can take various precautions to avoid congenital heart disease. First step is to consult a doctor before pregnancy to discuss medication that you are already taking. It is also recommended to take a rubella vaccination to avoid exposure to the disease. Furthermore by avoiding alcohol and substance abuse you can greatly decreases the risks of congenital hearty disease. In the case of diabetes speak to a specialist on how to manage blood sugar levels before and during pregnancy.</p>
